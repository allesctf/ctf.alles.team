        <p>
            <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/18419" target="_blank"><img src="alles.png" alt="ALLES"
                    class="alles-logo" /></a> is looking forward to host
            <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1313" target="_blank">this year's ALLES! CTF</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>When?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Begin</b>: Fri, 03 Sep 2021 16:00 UTC
            <br />
            <b>End</b>: Sun, 05 Sep 2021 4:00 UTC (36 hours)
        </p>
        <h3>Where?</h3>
        <p>
            The CTF is open to everyone and can be played online. You do not need to pre-register for the event. A
            CTFtime.org account will be required to sign into the event (make sure your team members have access!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Communication for this event will happen on <a href="https://discord.gg/h2tRFDk6Fy">Discord</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>
            We prepared typical challenges in the classic categories (Reversing, Forensics, Crypto, Web, Pwning, Devops,
            and Misc), plus some weird stuff you didn't expect! If you have played last year's ALLES! CTF 2020, you know
            what to expect.
        </p>
        <h3>Prize Pool</h3>
        <p>
            We're happy to announce that this year's ALLES!-CTF will have a very generous prize pool of $35,000,
            sponsored by our
            friends over at the <a href="https://solana.foundation/">Solana Foundation</a>. $25,000 are allocated to the
            top 10 in the following way:
        <ol>
            <li>$6,000</li>
            <li>$5,000</li>
            <li>$4,000</li>
            <li>$3,000</li>
            <li>$2,000</li>
            <li>$1,000</li>
            <li>$1,000</li>
            <li>$1,000</li>
            <li>$1,000</li>
            <li>$1,000</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p> We will also give $100 each to the 20 best writeups we receive after the event. Send us your writeups to <a
                href="mailto:allesctfteam+writeups@gmail.com">allesctfteam+writeups@gmail.com</a> until Sun, 19 Sep 2021
            anywhere on earth. We only accept pdf files.
        </p>
        <p> We have prepared 4 challenges that are especially challenging and will require a large amount of effort
            to solve. For each of these challenges, if the challenge has 20 solvers or less, $2,000 will be
            distributed among all solvers after the event is over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prizes will be paid out as USDC. Because we don't want to pay hundreds of dollars in transaction fees, we
            will distribute them on the Solana blockchain. You can either directly deposit your SPL-USDC on <a
                href="https://ftx.com/">FTX</a>, or trade them to SOL (which you can then deposit on any major
            exchange) on any Solana DEX or swap, like for example <a
                href="https://raydium.io/swap/?ammId=58oQChx4yWmvKdwLLZzBi4ChoCc2fqCUWBkwMihLYQo2">Raydium</a> or <a
                href="https://dex.projectserum.com/#/market/9wFFyRfZBsuAha4YcuxcXLKwMxJR43S7fPfQLusDBzvT">Serum</a>. We
            will also send 0.0001 SOL to any address that receives prize money, in order to cover any transaction fees
            that might apply while getting the funds onto an exchange. This is enough for 20 transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to be eligible for any prize money, you will have to send your Team token, which is displayed on
            the CTF platform, to <a href="mailto:allesctfteam+kyc@gmail.com">allesctfteam+kyc@gmail.com</a> until Sun,
            12 Sep 2021 anywhere on earth. Please also include the public key of a Solana account that you have access
            to. We recommend you use a wallet like <a href="https://phantom.app/">Phantom</a> or <a
                href="https://solflare.com/">Solflare</a> as both of those natively support SPL-token transfers and have
            integrations with most onchain exchanges and swaps.
        </p>
